# TasQ - Terminal Task Manager

A powerful, lightweight task management system with both Terminal User Interface (TUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI) capabilities. Perfect for project-based task management with per-directory task databases.

## Features

- üéØ **Dual Interface**: Rich TUI for interactive management, CLI for automation
- üìÅ **Per-Directory Tasks**: Each directory maintains its own task database
- ‚ö° **Priority System**: 5-level priority system with visual indicators
- ‚úÖ **Task Completion**: Mark tasks complete with visual strikethrough
- üîç **Task Details**: Comprehensive task information in modal view
- üóÇÔ∏è **SQLite Backend**: Reliable local database storage
- üé® **Color-Coded**: Priority-based color coding for quick visual scanning

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/tasq/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release binary:
```bash
curl -L -o tasq https://github.com/yourusername/tasq/releases/latest/download/tasq
chmod +x tasq
sudo mv tasq /usr/local/bin/
```

### Build from Source

**Prerequisites:**
- Rust 1.70+ (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))

**Build steps:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tasq.git
cd tasq
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/tasq /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

```bash
# Add a new task
tasq add "Implement user authentication" --priority 1

# List all tasks
tasq list

# List only pending tasks
tasq list --pending

# List only completed tasks
tasq list --completed

# Get the next highest priority task
tasq next

# Complete a task (by ID or search term)
tasq complete 5
tasq complete "authentication"

# Set task priority
tasq set-priority 5 1  # Set task 5 to priority 1 (urgent)
tasq set-priority "auth" 2  # Set task containing "auth" to priority 2
```

### Terminal User Interface (TUI)

Launch the interactive TUI by running `tasq` without arguments:

```bash
tasq
```

#### TUI Controls

**Navigation:**
- `‚Üë/k` - Previous task
- `‚Üì/j` - Next task
- `Shift+‚Üë/K` - Move task up
- `Shift+‚Üì/J` - Move task down

**Task Management:**
- `Space` - Toggle task completion
- `Enter` - View task details
- `i` - Add new task
- `d` - Delete selected task
- `+/=` - Increase priority (more urgent)
- `-/_` - Decrease priority (less urgent)

**View Options:**
- `c` - Toggle between showing all tasks and pending only
- `q` - Quit

#### Priority System

Tasks use a 5-level priority system:

| Priority | Color  | Indicator | Description |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 1        | Red    | !!!!!     | Urgent      |
| 2        | Yellow | !!!!      | High        |
| 3        | White  | !!!       | Normal      |
| 4        | Blue   | !!        | Low         |
| 5        | Gray   | !         | Very Low    |

## Database Structure

TasQ uses SQLite databases stored as `tasks.db` in each directory where you run the command. This enables project-specific task management.

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    priority INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 3,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    completed_at TEXT,
    position INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

### Data Flow

1. **Creation**: Tasks are inserted with timestamp and position
2. **Ordering**: Tasks are ordered by: completion status ‚Üí priority ‚Üí position ‚Üí creation time
3. **Updates**: Priority and completion changes update the database immediately
4. **Persistence**: All changes are immediately written to SQLite

## Project Integration

Since TasQ creates per-directory databases, you can:

- Run `tasq` in any project directory
- Each project maintains its own task list
- Switch between projects seamlessly
- Use in automation scripts and CI/CD pipelines

## MCP Server Integration

TasQ includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for integration with Claude and other AI assistants. See the `mcp-tasq/` directory for setup instructions.

## Installation Script

For easy installation, save this as `install.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# TasQ Installation Script
echo "Installing TasQ..."

# Detect OS and architecture
OS=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
ARCH=$(uname -m)

case $ARCH in
    x86_64)
        ARCH="x86_64"
        ;;
    arm64|aarch64)
        ARCH="aarch64"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unsupported architecture: $ARCH"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

# Download URL (update with actual GitHub release URL)
DOWNLOAD_URL="https://github.com/yourusername/tasq/releases/latest/download/tasq-${OS}-${ARCH}"

# Create temporary directory
TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
cd "$TEMP_DIR"

# Download binary
echo "Downloading TasQ..."
if command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    curl -L -o tasq "$DOWNLOAD_URL"
elif command -v wget >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    wget -O tasq "$DOWNLOAD_URL"
else
    echo "Error: curl or wget is required"
    exit 1
fi

# Make executable
chmod +x tasq

# Install to system
if [ -w "/usr/local/bin" ]; then
    mv tasq /usr/local/bin/
    echo "TasQ installed to /usr/local/bin/tasq"
elif [ -w "$HOME/.local/bin" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
    mv tasq "$HOME/.local/bin/"
    echo "TasQ installed to $HOME/.local/bin/tasq"
    echo "Make sure $HOME/.local/bin is in your PATH"
else
    echo "Installing to /usr/local/bin (requires sudo)..."
    sudo mv tasq /usr/local/bin/
    echo "TasQ installed to /usr/local/bin/tasq"
fi

# Cleanup
cd /
rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"

# Verify installation
if command -v tasq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "‚úÖ Installation successful!"
    echo "Run 'tasq --help' to get started"
else
    echo "‚ùå Installation failed. Please check your PATH"
    exit 1
fi
```

Make it executable and run:
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
